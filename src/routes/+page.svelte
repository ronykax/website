        hi, i'm <a href="/bio">rony</a> and i love building cool shit.

        <br />
        <br />

        sometimes it's a dumb project that doesn't help anyone. other times,
        it's something that solves a real problem.

        <br />
        <br />

        at the end of the day, if whatever i made makes someone go "yo, this is
        kinda sick" then i'm doing it right.

        <!-- <br />
        <br /> -->

        <!-- follow me on <a href="/">ùïè</a> or <a href="/">github</a>. sometimes i
        post on <a href="/">youtube</a>. -->

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>check out some of my projects below!</strong>
    </p>
