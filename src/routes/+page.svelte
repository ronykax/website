        hi, i'm <a href="/bio">rony</a> and i love building cool shit.

        <br />
        <br />

        sometimes it's a dumb app that doesn't help anyone. other times, it's
        something that solves a real problem.

        <br />
        <br />

        at the end of the day, if whatever i made makes someone go "yo this is
        kinda sick" then i'm doing it right.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>here's some experiments i'm proud of:</strong>
    </p>

    <br />

    <ul class="text-lg opacity-75 leading-snug">
        {#each projects as item}
            <li>
                <div class="flex w-full">
                    <span class="mr-2.5">*</span>
                    <div class="w-full">
                        <div class="flex justify-between w-full">
                            <a href={item.url} target="_blank">
                                {item.name}
                            </a>

                            <span class="opacity-65">
                                {item.year}
                            </span>
                        </div>
                        <span class="opacity-65">
                            {item.description}
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br />
            </li>
        {/each}
    </ul>

    <br />

    <p class="opacity-75 text-lg">
